# Chronic-Health-Analysis

First of all, make sure to include in your project folder the CDC dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/u-s-chronic-disease-indicators/data. It is too large for me to upload to this repo.

You should be able to run Analysis.ipynb to start looking at correlates, with a guide in the comments for how to use this Jupyter Notebook.

You guys can ignore Preprocessing.ipynb unless you want to see how I did the preprocessing.
